# Windows Installation

This app is designed as a local Windows workflow for reviewing videos with Meta TRIBE v2.

## Requirements

Recommended local setup:

- Windows 10/11 64-bit
- Python 3.11
- 16 GB RAM
- Modern 8-core CPU or better
- NVIDIA GPU
- 6 GB VRAM minimum, 12 GB+ preferred
- 30 GB+ free disk space, preferably on SSD

The first launch downloads Python packages, official TRIBE v2 model files, the Whisper speech model, and local video/audio tooling.

## 1. Download

1. Open the GitHub repository page.
2. Click the green `Code` button.
3. Click `Download ZIP`.
4. Wait for the ZIP file to finish downloading.

## 2. Extract

1. Right-click the downloaded ZIP file.
2. Click `Extract All`.
3. Choose a normal folder such as `Desktop` or `Downloads`.
4. Open the extracted folder.

Do not run the app directly from inside the ZIP preview.

## 3. First launch

1. Double-click `Start_TRIBE_Review.cmd`.
2. A black terminal window will open.
3. Keep it open. The app is creating its local environment and downloading the model files.
4. The first setup can take a while.
5. When the terminal says setup is complete, close the terminal.

## 4. Start the app

Double-click `Start_TRIBE_Review.cmd` again.

The browser should open automatically. If it does not, open this address manually:

```url
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Later launches are much faster because the setup files are already installed.

## 5. Optional Hugging Face login

If the model download fails because Hugging Face asks for access, run this inside the project folder after `.venv` exists:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\huggingface-cli.exe login
```

Paste a Hugging Face token that has access to the required model files, then run `Start_TRIBE_Review.cmd` again.

## 6. Optional cache path

By default, the app uses:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\tribe_cache
```

To override it:

```powershell
$env:TRIBE_CACHE_DIR = "D:\tribe_cache"
```

## 7. Optional Ollama setup

The app works without Ollama. If Ollama is available, it can be used as a local copy-rewriting layer.

Install Ollama, then pull one of the supported local models:

```powershell
ollama pull qwen3.5:9b
```

If no supported Ollama model is found, the app falls back to deterministic built-in copy.
